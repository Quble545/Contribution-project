# Contribution-project

#this project is a dotnet core backend and React in frontend
to run this project you need first to install sql server or my sql then you need to install dotnet core 3 sdk, nodejs and npm in your computer

after you do that you can use visual studio or Visual studio code wich i'm using, if you are using Visual studio it's enough but if you are using visual studo code you need to install some extension(sql server, c#, c# extention, Debuger for chrome).

That's all.

Thank.
